# polylux-unipd

[Polylux](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux) theme inspired by [beamer-padova](https://www.math.unipd.it/~burattin/other/tema-latex-beamer-padova/), roughly based on [typst-slides-unipd](https://github.com/SkiFire13/typst-slides-unipd) and [polylux-university](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux/blob/main/themes/university.typ).

I'm too lazy to write a proper documentation so you'll have to figure it out yourself but an [example](./slides.typ) is provided, you can see it built [here](./slides.pdf). Beware that the example is kinda broken on some long titles, but nothing show-stopping :)
